# TriviaGame

This game is dino themed. It has been purposely built with the flexibility to add the following features in the future (STILL HAVE NOT BEEN ADDED):
1) the ability for the user to choose their topic of choice
2) to eventually draw questions from an API
3)the ability for the users to decide how many questions they would like
4) the ability for the user to do a speed round or normal round

FEATURES THAT WORK:
- Dino themed questions with timer
-The game time adjusts to the amount of questions as the timer is not restricted to a certain amount of loops
-flip card css style
-reset button
-statistics

WHAT NEEDS ATTENTION:
-styling/colors, rounding edges, positioning of graphics
-the statistics at the end aren't rounded
